# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Udacity AI Nano Degree

# Introduction
This repository contains all the projects and labs from the Udacity AI nanodgree program done by me. The intention of this repository is to act as a personal project placeholder for future references.

# Projects
The following is a list of abstracts on all the projects.

## AIND-Soduku
A project that builds a Soduku solver that can automatically solve Soduku. It also has a very nice visualization of the process.

## AIND-Isoluation
A project that develops an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation".  Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board.  Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game.  The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.

## AIND-Planning
A project that solves deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using a planning search agent.
With progression search algorithms like those in the navigation problem from lecture, optimal plans for each problem will be computed. Also, domain-independent heuristics are used.

## AIND-Recognizer
A project that builds a sign langurage recognizer that can recognize [American Sign Langurages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language).

## AIND-Dog-Project
A project that builds a dog breed identifier using [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). The identifier also detects human faces and match them with the closest breed of dogs.

## AIND-RNN
A project that builds a text generator using [RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network). The generator will first be trained with all Sherlock Holmes novels and generates new novels pieces.

## AIND-Capstone
